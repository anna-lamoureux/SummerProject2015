# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

To run the server, please execute the following:

```
sudo pip3 install -U connexion # install Connexion from PyPI
python3 app.py
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger.json
```

## Description

The Healthkit API uses Connexion to automatically handle http requests sent to the Flask server based on the OpenAPI specification located in [swagger/swagger.yaml](swagger/swagger.yaml).

Controller methods are located in [controllers/default_controller.py](controllers/default_controller.py). 

Specifications for the MySQL database are located in [specs/Healthkit_Database_Initialization.sql](specs/Healthkit_Database_Initialization.sql), test data can be found in both [test_data_init.sql](specs/test_data_init.sql), and [demo_db_init.sql](specs/demo_db_init.sql). 

Tests against the API using Python's Request library can be found in [tests/tests.py](tests/tests.py). These tests require test data from [test_data_init.sql](specs/test_data_init.sql). _In this version: Some 'add' and 'update' tests may have adverse effects on other tests, also some bad requests currently send 500 errors instead of 400 errors._
